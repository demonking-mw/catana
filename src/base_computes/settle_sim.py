"""Settlement setup-phase simulator.

Simulates the full Catan 4-player snake-draft (8 placements) to produce
placeout scenarios for each of the current player's settlement options.

Uses:
  - ``top_settle_spots`` to generate the player's own candidate spots.
  - ``settle_decision`` to predict where every other player will settle.
  
python3 src/tests/test_settle_sim.py src/sample.json

Output is a comparison structure: one entry per candidate option, each
paired with up to *max_window* placeout board states and their
combined probabilities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gs : GameState
        Current board state.  ``meta.p_curr`` identifies whose turn it
        is ("me").  The phase is expected to be ``"settle"``.
    x : int
        Number of top settlement spots to evaluate — same *x* that
        ``top_settle_spots`` uses.  Do **not** redefine here; it is
        forwarded directly.
    max_window : int
        Maximum number of placeout scenarios retained per settlement
        option.  After each simulated placement, if the case count
        exceeds this value, only the top *max_window* by combined
        probability are kept and re-normalized.

    Returns
    -------
    list of ``((settle_spot, road_spot), [(GameState, probability), ...])``

    *   One entry per candidate option (up to *x*).
    *   ``settle_spot``: node key ``"T1_T2_T3"`` for the player's pick.
    *   ``road_spot``: edge key ``"T1_T2"`` for the accompanying road.
    *   The inner list contains up to *max_window* fully-resolved
        placeout board states (all 8 settlements placed) and the
        combined probability of that placeout occurring.

    Notes
    -----
    *   The probability of the player's own initial placement is treated
        as **1.0** (we are comparing options, not weighting them).
    *   Combined probabilities are computed by multiplication across
        successive settle_decision predictions.
    *   The function does **not** estimate the relative likelihood of the
        player's *own* options; that comparison is the caller's job.
