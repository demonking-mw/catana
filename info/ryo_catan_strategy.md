## 1. Initial Settlement Placement

### First Settlement (Pick 1 of ~54 spots)
- **Priority resources:**
- **Production vs. diversity tradeoff:**
- **Port access considerations:**
- **Number distribution (pips) target:**
- **Avoiding overlap with likely opponent picks:**

### Second Settlement (Complementing the first)
- **What resources am I missing?**
- **Do I go for a port or balance production?**
- **Road direction intent (where am I expanding toward?):**
- **Blocking considerations:**

---

## 2. Road Strategy

### Early Game (Turns 1-20)
- **Expand toward which settlement spot?**
- **When to prioritize roads over other builds:**
- **Longest Road race — when to commit vs. ignore:**

### Mid/Late Game
- **Defensive roads (blocking opponents):**
- **When is Longest Road worth 2 VP vs. building cities:**
- **Road Building dev card — optimal timing:**

---

## 3. Settlement & City Strategy

### When to Build Settlements
- **3rd settlement timing:**
- **Preferred spots (port access, high production, blocking):**
- **Settlement vs. City — which to prioritize and when:**

### When to Build Cities
- **Which settlement to upgrade first and why:**
- **OWS (Ore-Wheat-Sheep) city rush — when does this work?**
- **Risk: cities make you a bigger robber target:**

---

## 4. Resource Management

### Production Profile Archetypes
- **Balanced (all 5 resources):** When is this good?
- **Wood/Brick heavy (road/settlement):** When to lean into this?
- **Ore/Grain heavy (city/dev card):** When to lean into this?
- **Wool-starved:** How to compensate?

### Card Count Awareness
- **Staying at/under 7 cards before dice roll:**
- **When to hold vs. when to spend immediately:**
- **Discard strategy (what to keep when over 7):**

---

## 5. Trading Strategy

### With Players
- **When to initiate trades:**
- **What to never trade away (situational):**
- **Reading opponent needs — using trades as information:**
- **Denying resources to the leader:**
- **Accepting bad trades — when is it worth it?**

### With Bank/Ports
- **4:1 bank trades — when are they justified?**
- **2:1 port usage — is it worth settling on a port early?**
- **3:1 port — versatility vs. specific 2:1:**

---

## 6. Development Card Strategy

### When to Buy Dev Cards
- **Conditions that make dev cards attractive:**
- **Tempo cost of buying vs. building:**
- **How many dev cards is too many?**

### Knight Cards
- **When to play vs. hold:**
- **Largest Army race — when to commit:**
- **Robber placement (who to target and why):**
- **Using knights defensively (moving robber off yourself):**

### Victory Point Cards
- **Holding for surprise win:**
- **Adjusting public VP display to avoid being targeted:**

### Monopoly
- **Best resources to monopolize and when:**
- **Timing: after opponents collect from a good roll?**
- **Bluffing / information hiding before playing:**

### Year of Plenty
- **Best use cases (completing a build immediately):**
- **Combining with other actions in the same turn:**

### Road Building
- **When to play (Longest Road push, cutting off opponents):**
- **Saving for the right moment vs. using early:**

---

## 7. Robber Strategy
- Determine which resource hinders other players' development. E.g. If sheep is abundant don't rob sheep. 
- Target the leader who is the most closest to winning.
- Target the player who threatens you specifically. E.g.: Someone competing for the same spots, about to cut off your road. 
  - Use this to calculate simple robber heatmap.
  - Use this to calculate simple scoring.
  - Use this to calculate advanced robber heatmap.
  - Use this and AI to calculate relative strength. 

### When You Roll 7
- **Who to target (leader? resource-rich? personal threat?):**
- **Which tile to block (highest production? opponent-specific?):**
- **Stealing: which player and why:**

### When You're Targeted
- **How to dissuade robbers (table talk, threat of retaliation):**
- **Diversifying settlements to reduce robber impact:**
- **When to use a knight to move it off:**

---

## 8. Opponent Reading & Meta

### Tracking Opponent Resources
- **Watching what they collect each roll:**
- **Inferring hand from trade offers/rejections:**
- **Counting cards after steals and discards:**

### Threat Assessment
- **Who is closest to winning?**
- **Hidden VP estimation (dev cards held long = likely VP):**
- **When to shift from building to blocking:**

### Table Talk & Psychology
- **Convincing others to rob the leader:**
- **Making yourself seem non-threatening:**
- **Trade leverage — creating perceived mutual benefit:**

---

## 9. Endgame Tactics (7-9 VP)

- **Closing out the last 1-2 VP — preferred methods:**
- **Hidden VP surprise wins:**
- **Denying opponents their final VP (robber, blocking, refusing trades):**
- **Timing a big turn (dev card + build in one turn):**

---

## 10. Situational Adjustments

### When Behind
- **How to catch up:**
- **Risk tolerance increase?**
- **Targeting the leader vs. focusing on own engine:**

### When Ahead
- **How to close out without drawing too much attention:**
- **Defensive play (hold knights, avoid trading):**
- **Speed vs. stealth:**

### Board-Specific Notes
- **Desert in center vs. edge — how it changes strategy:**
- **Clustered high numbers — fight for them or avoid the crowd?**
- **Rare resource (only 1 tile) — how much to value it:**
